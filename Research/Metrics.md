# Metrics

Here are a couple important Kubernetes metrics listed for the different levels



### Node Level:

1. #### Node Memory Pressure:

   - Metric that lets us determine the memory consumption of a Node [2]

   - It lets us prevent unnecessary evictions in case of a high memory usage

     

2. #### Node CPU Utilization

   - This metric allows us to determine the CPU usage of a Node [2]
   - It is important if we have sensitive applications/pods running on a node with high CPU utilization
